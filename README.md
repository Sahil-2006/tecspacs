## 💡 Inspiration

Developers frequently reuse code snippets and mini utilities across projects, but organizing, reusing, and sharing them is often a hassle. Tools like `npm` or `pip` are too heavyweight for personal use, while note-taking apps like Notion aren’t designed for live code reuse. We set out to build a developer-first tool that’s light, visual, and fun—like pinning your favorite code onto a digital sketchbook.
